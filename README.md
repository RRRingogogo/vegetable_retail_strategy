### Problem C: Automated Pricing and Restocking Decisions for Vegetable Products

In fresh food supermarkets, vegetable products typically have short shelf lives, with their appearance deteriorating as time goes on. Most types, if unsold on the day, cannot be sold the following day. Therefore, supermarkets usually restock daily based on each product's historical sales and demand data.

Given the large variety of vegetables, differing places of origin, and the typical procurement time (between 3:00 AM and 4:00 AM), the supermarket must make daily restocking decisions for each vegetable category without precise knowledge of the exact items or purchase prices. Pricing for vegetables generally follows a "cost-plus pricing" model, with discounts applied to items with transport damage or quality degradation. Reliable market demand analysis is critical for both restocking and pricing decisions. On the demand side, vegetable sales often show a time-related pattern; on the supply side, vegetable availability is generally abundant from April to October. Limited sales space in the supermarket further emphasizes the importance of an optimal sales mix.

Attachment 1 provides information on six categories of vegetables sold at a supermarket; Attachments 2 and 3 provide relevant data on the sales details and wholesale prices of each product from July 1, 2020, to June 30, 2023; and Attachment 4 provides recent loss rate data for each product. Based on the attachments and actual conditions, please develop a mathematical model to address the following problems:

#### Problem 1
There may be certain relationships between different vegetable categories or individual items. Please analyze the distribution patterns and interrelationships of sales volumes for each vegetable category and item.

#### Problem 2
Considering the supermarket plans its restocking by category, please analyze the relationship between each vegetable category's total sales volume and cost-plus pricing, and propose a daily restocking volume and pricing strategy for each vegetable category for the upcoming week (July 1–7, 2023) to maximize supermarket revenue.

#### Problem 3
Due to limited sales space for vegetables, the supermarket wants to create an item-specific restocking plan, aiming to limit the number of sellable items to 27–33. Additionally, the order volume for each item must meet a minimum display quantity of 2.5 kg. Based on the sellable items from June 24–30, 2023, determine the restocking volume and pricing strategy for each item on July 1, while striving to meet market demand for each vegetable category to maximize supermarket revenue.

#### Problem 4
To make better restocking and pricing decisions for vegetable products, what additional data should the supermarket collect? How would this data assist in addressing the above problems? Please provide your suggestions and reasoning.

- Attachment 1: Information on six categories of vegetables
- Attachment 2: Sales transaction detail data
- Attachment 3: Wholesale prices of vegetable products
- Attachment 4: Recent loss rates of vegetable products
